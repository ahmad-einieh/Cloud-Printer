print bill on foodics or sunmi cloud printer

----------------------------------------------

you can start test from program.cs file printer.cs file it is have print method if you want see it.

DirectPrinterProcess.cs it is for only edit text when want to print bill.

DirectPrintingScript.cs it is just a model to give string and format of text to print method.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


you need to fill print method with ip address and port number to start print process 
and you need give list of DirectPrintingScript.cs to print method as example in program.cs file.
